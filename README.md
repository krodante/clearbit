# README

Thank you for reviewing my transaction repo!

This application is built on Ruby v2.5.3 and Rails v5.2.2

I didn't think a database was necessary for this particular use case, so you don't have to do any additional db setup.

I've added a .env.sample file for loading environment variables. I'll send the real values in a file along with this repo, but please let me know if you need another copy.

I've added rubocop for cleanliness and rspec for testing. You can run those checks with:

`rubocop`

and

`rspec spec`

Please let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
